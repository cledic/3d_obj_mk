Raspberry 3D Object Maker
=========
This is a very old software that I realize long time ago.
First run was on a Atari 1040. Then I ported the software to a 386 PC.
Years ago I ported this software to LPC2478 board. But now was time to test it on a Raspberry!

Thanks to Texy I put a LCD on my raspy. So I decide to realize this porting using LCD+touch+C code.

Inside the lib directory there is specific makefile to build sample of the touch and graphics library.
